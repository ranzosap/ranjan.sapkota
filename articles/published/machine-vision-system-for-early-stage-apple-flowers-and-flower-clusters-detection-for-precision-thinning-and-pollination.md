    abstract: "Early-stage identification of fruit flowers that are in both opened and unopened condition in an orchard environment is significant information to perform crop load management operations such as flower thinning and pollination using automated and robotic platforms. These operations are important in tree-fruit agriculture to enhance fruit quality, manage crop load, and enhance the overall profit. The recent development in agricultural automation suggests that this can be done using robotics which includes machine vision technology. In this article, we proposed a vision system that detects early-stage flowers in an unstructured orchard environment using YOLOv5 object detection algorithm. For the robotics implementation, the position of a cluster of the flower blossom is important to navigate the robot and the end effector. The centroid of individual flowers (both open and unopen) was identified and associated with flower clusters via K-means clustering. The accuracy of the opened and unopened flower detection is achieved up to mAP of 81.9% in commercial orchard images."

Various machine vision technologies have been applied using various types of object detection algorithms in agriculture automation for more than a decade. Nilsback and
Zisserman (2006) proposed a visual vocabulary that can support object classification for flowers that have a significant visual similarity using traditional image processing methods. Traditional image processing techniques consist
of various operations such as image enhancement, image restoration, and image analysis that can be performed to manipulate images using digital computers. Another
early study on feature extraction of lesquerella flower was presented by Thorp and Dierig (2011), where the authors developed an image processing algorithm to detect flowers using image segmentation by transforming the image to the hue, saturation, and intensity (HSI) color space. Hoˇcevar et al. (2014) estimated the number of flower clusters of individual trees in a high-density apple orchard by implementing apple flower detection based on thresholding and morphological image processing in hue, saturation, luminance (HSL) color space image. Likewise, there are several studies that performed flower detection using the traditional image processing methods such as morphological image processing and various segmentation
techniques including Otsu’s method, and classifying the flower color group with contour shapes using k-mean
