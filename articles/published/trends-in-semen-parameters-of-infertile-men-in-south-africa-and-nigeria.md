    abstract: "There are conflicting reports on trends of semen parameters from different parts of the globe. However, in recent times there is dearth of information on the trend in Sub-Saharan countries. Therefore, in this study we aimed at determining the trends in semen parameters in Nigeria and South Africa between 2010 and 2019. A retrospective study of semen analyses of 17,292 men attending fertility hospitals in Nigeria and South Africa in 2010, 2015 and 2019. Patients who had undergone vasectomy and those who had a pH less than 5 or greater than 10 were excluded from this study. The following variables were assessed: ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, progressive motility, total progressively motile sperm count (TPMSC), total sperm count, and normal sperm morphology. Between 2010 and 2019, significant trends of decreasing values were observed in normal sperm morphology (− 50%), and the ejaculatory volume (− 7.4%), indicating a progressive deterioration of the values in both countries. In Nigeria, there were significant decreases in progressive motility (− 87%), TPMSC (− 78%), and sperm morphology (− 55%) between 2010 and 2019 (P < 0.001). Spearman`s rank correlation revealed significant negative associations between age and morphology (ρ =  − 0.24, P < 0.001), progressive motility (ρ =  − 0.31. P < 0.001), and TPMSC (ρ =  − 0.32, P < 0.001). Patients in South Africa were younger than those from Nigeria, with also a significantly higher sperm morphology, sperm concentration, progressive motility, total sperm count and TPMSC. Our findings provide a quantitative evidence of an alarming decreasing trend in semen parameters in Nigeria and South Africa from 2010 to 2019. It also proves that astheno- and teratozoospermia are the leading causes of male infertility in these regions. In addition to this, it also shows empirically that semen parameters decrease with advancement in age. These findings are the first report of temporal trends in semen parameters in Sub-Saharan countries, necessitating a thorough investigation on the underlying factors promoting this worrisome decline."

    Semen parameters including sperm concentration, total sperm count, sperm motility, total progressive motile sperm count (TPMSC), sperm morphology, and semen volume are essential diagnostic tools for assessing the reproductive health and fertility status of men1. Several studies have revealed conflicting results on the trend of semen parameters postulating there are no temporal trends and if there are then they are region dependent however, a decline has been observed since the late 1930s in western countries including the United States, Australia, and Europe2,3,4,5.

Aberrations in sperm parameters remain the leading cause of male factor infertility6. Between 1965–2015, Sengupta et al.7 reported an over 32% reduction in sperm concentration among European men. From the most populous countries in Asia, Adiga et al.8, reported 22.92%, 30.3% and 51.25% decrease in sperm motility, sperm count, and morphology respectively among Indian men. Similarly, significant decline in sperm concentration and total sperm count has been reported among 327 373 Chinese men within four decades9. From South America, a 23-year (1995–2018) study in Brazil also reported decline in sperm parameters10. Another study reported an overall 73% decline in sperm concentration in African men over a period of 50 years (1965–2015)11.

Globally, the declining trend in semen parameters seem to be more consistent however, in recent times there is paucity of information on the trends of semen parameters in Sub-Saharan African countries. This makes it difficult to ascertain the enormity of the burden of male factor infertility in African families. Therefore, in this study we aim at identifying the prevalence, and trends of semen parameters in Nigeria and South Africa between 2010 and 2019.
